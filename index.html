              <p class="lead">A hackathon is a digital workshop in which computer programmers, graphic designers, interface designers, project managers, community activists, artists and other interested members of the community to collaborate intensively on solving problems.</p>
              <p class="lead">Hackathons typically start with one or more presentations about the event, as well as about the specific subject, followed by allowing the participants to suggest ideas and form teams, based on individual interests and skills. Then the main work of the hackathon begins, which can last anywhere from several hours to several days.  At the end of the hackathon, there is usually a series of demonstrations in which each group presents the outcome of their collaboration. There is sometimes a contest element as well, in which a panel of judges select the winning teams, and prizes are given. At many hackathons, the judges are made up of organizers and sponsors.

He manages the <a href="http://www.northeastallianceforrail.org/">Northeast Alliance for Rail</a>, a coalition of more than 50 leading business and civic groups, dedicated to promoting improved passenger rail service and the construction of a new dedicated high-speed rail system, making the Northeast a more attractive place to do business.
